What this is
- Further elaboration of Vision Processing with an emphasis on strategies that use Vision in relation to the game, and how it can assist automation
- Pathplanner demonstration with 
- References and explanations for how 4451's robot, Riptide, functioned

Who this is for
- Programming teams that want to introduce deterministic automation
- Teams that want to further implement strategies from vision
- Vision-derived path following

Quick start (3 steps)
1. Clone the following repositories
  - https://github.com/firstsouthcarolina/Symposium2025
  - https://github.com/frc4451/Riptide2025
2. Open the WPILib's Version of Visual Studio Code
3. Do either of the following, depending on where you are with the presentation
  a. Open the `minimal_max_swerve_demo` folder for various demos
  b. Open the `Riptide` repository to see examples of 
  - Global Pose Estimation
  - Vision Simulation
  - Targeting at points of interest
  - Implementation of Choreo in addition to vision-determined pathing

What's included
- Modified Swerve base for MAX Swerve — Built from AdvantageKit base with Vision additions.

Goals
1. Show how to use Vision to determine pathing
2. Show how to use PathPlanner for predetermined paths


Glossary
- Vision: Software used to enable the robot to "see" and perform actions with new information.
- PhotonVision: Open sourced software package for various Computer Vision tasks.
- PathPlanner: Open sourced software package for path following in FRC.
