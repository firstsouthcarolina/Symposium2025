What this is
- Full explanation of how and why you should consider using vision processing on an FRC robot
- An example of how to aim at a target using PhotonVision
- References and explanations for how 4451's robot, Riptide, functioned

Who this is for
- Programming teams that want to introduce deterministic automation
- Drive teams that want "cruise control" to make their job easier

Quick start (3 steps)
1. Clone the following repositories
  - https://github.com/firstsouthcarolina/Symposium2025
  - https://github.com/frc4451/Riptide2025
2. Open the WPILib's Version of Visual Studio Code
3. Do either of the following, depending on where you are with the presentation
  a. Open the `aimattarget` folder for aiming at a predetermined tag
  b. Open the `Riptide` repository to see examples of 
  - Global Pose Estimation
  - Vision Simulation
  - Targeting at points of interest

What's included
- AimAtTarget — runnable example to show how to aim at a target.

Goals
1. Show how simulated motors connect to existing subsystem code.
2. Feed simulated motor data into visualizations so results are easy to see.
3. Build clear visual mechanisms so non-programmers can understand the workflow.


Glossary
- Vision: Software used to enable the robot to "see" and perform actions with new information.
- PhotonVision: Open sourced software package for various Computer Vision tasks.
